# package-json-cli-editor
Silly simple package json cli based editor.

# installation

```shell
$ npm install package-json-cli-editor
```

# Usage

For lack of a better binary name it's `pkged`

```shell
$ pkged
```

Anything else and it would be too many characters to type.

Follow on-screen options from there.
